ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]


1. method toss in class CoinTossSimulator

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
Q1: In CS 455 what code from the web are you allowed to use in your assignment solution,
assuming you modify that code once you get it?

Ans:
You cannot use the code from the website EXCEPT Java API document.



Q2: What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial:
two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two?

Ans:
Two heads and two tails: 1/4; one head and one tail: 1/2

The probability of head or tail for each toss is 1/2.
When tossing two coins, each coin is independent, so the probability of two heads is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, which is the same as two tails
The remaining situation is one head and one tail, and its probability is 1 - 1/4 - 1/4 = 1/2.



Q3: Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities?
Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.

Ans:
About 5000 ~ 10000 trials, the result will be within 1% of the probabilities in Q2.


Q4: Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error?

Ans:
at most for 2,147,483,647 trails

1 billion trials -> ok
2 billion trials -> ok
2,147,483,647 trials -> ok
2,147,483,648 trials -> fail, Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
